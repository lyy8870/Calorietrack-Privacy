Privacy Policy for CalorieTrack

Effective Date: [10/11/2025]

CalorieTrack (“we,” “our,” or “us”) respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle data when you use our mobile application, CalorieTrack (the “App”).

1. Information We Collect

1.1 Camera Access
The App uses your device’s camera to take photos of food. Photos are used only for food recognition and calorie estimation. Photos are not stored or shared by us unless explicitly stated.

1.2 AI Processing
When you take a photo, it is securely sent to an AI model (e.g., Hugging Face Inference API) for image recognition. The processing occurs on external servers, and the photo is used solely for identifying food items and estimating nutritional information.

1.3 User-Provided Information
If you choose to create an account or enter personal details (such as height, weight, or goals), this data is stored locally on your device or in our secure database for providing personalized calorie goals and analytics.

We do not collect personally identifiable information unless you provide it voluntarily.

2. How We Use Information

To estimate calorie and nutrition information from images.

To display personalized nutrition and activity suggestions.

To improve app functionality and user experience.

3. Data Security

We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect your information.
Your photos and input data are transmitted securely using HTTPS encryption.

4. Data Sharing

We do not sell, rent, or trade your data.
Limited data (images) are transmitted temporarily to third-party AI APIs (e.g., Hugging Face) only for food recognition purposes. These services have their own privacy policies.

5. Your Rights

You can:

Delete your account or app data at any time.

Revoke camera permissions via device settings.

Contact us for questions or data removal requests.

6. Children’s Privacy

Our App is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children.
